 style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">In 1950 Alan Turing published 'Computer Machinery and Intelligence' which tested machine intelligence called The Imitation Game.
In 1952 Arthur Samuel a computer scientist created a program to play checkers. The first to ever learn the game independently.
In 1955 John McCarthy held a workshop at Dartmouth on “artificial intelligence” which is the first use of the word

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;"><big><small>In 2012 Jeff Dean and Andrew Ng who are researchers from Google,  trained a network to recognize cats by showing it unlabeled images with no background information.
In 2016 Hanson Robotics created a humanoid robot named Sophia, who became known as the first 'robot citizen' and was the first robot created with a realistic human look and was able to see and copy emotions, and could also communicate.
In 2018 A Chinese tech group called Alibaba’s  had a language-processing AI beat human intellect on the  Stanford reading and comprehension test.
In 2020 OpenAI started beta testing GPT-3, a model that uses Deep Learning to create code, poetry, and other and writing tasks. It is not the first type of program like this but , it is the first that creates responses  almost indistinguishable from those created by humans.
In 2021 OpenAI developed DALL-E, which can process and understand images enough to produce accurate captions, improving  AIs  understanding in  the visual world.
In 2022 a large language model–based chatbot (CHATGPT) was created by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, which enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language.
