      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;"><big>Education: AI will likely be different depending on age group.Students will get educational content and trainings made for their specific needs. This will lead to different educational strategies based on students individual learning styles. By 2028, the education system could be drastically different.  
Healthcare: AI will likely become a normal tool for doctors and physician assistants with diagnostic work. People should expect the rate of accurate medical diagnosis to increase. “But the sensitivity of patient data and complexity of navigating the laws that protect them are also likely to lead to an even more complicated medical-legal environment and increased costs of doing business.” Meaning improved care, but at a higher price.
Finance: Natural language processing combined with machine learning will let banks and financial advisors and sophisticated chatbots to efficiently engage with clients ( credit score monitoring, fraud detection, financial planning, insurance policy matters and customer service.)
Transportation: The near-term future will see more autonomous vehicles in private and commercial use. The cars people drive to work, trucks carrying goods along the highway, even space crafts bringing humans and cargo to the moon will likely be using self driving vehicles

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;">The term deepfake refers to an AI-based technique that synthesizes media. This technology allows people to create videos or pictures of another person, with there face on it. 
“They can be designed to harass, intimidate, demean and undermine people. Deepfakes can also create misinformation and confusion about important issues.”
https://youtu.be/AmUC4m6w1wo?feature=shared EXAMPLE
“Deepfake technology enables anyone with a computer and an Internet connection to create realistic-looking photos and videos of people saying and doing things that they did not actually say or do.”
Although there are positive things about AI the use of this technology is almost always used in a negative way and can be a big concern.

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;">Although AI can be useful, it is often worried that AI will progress in intelligence so rapidly that it will become beyond humans control.  'Facebook's artificial intelligence robots shut down after they start talking to each other in their own language'
'Facebook abandoned an experiment after two artificially intelligent programs appeared to be chatting to each other in a strange language only they understood. The two chatbots came to create their own changes to English that made it easier for them to work – but which remained mysterious to the humans that supposedly look after them.'
