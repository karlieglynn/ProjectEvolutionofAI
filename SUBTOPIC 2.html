Ai can be used in school by assisting with translations,  language learning,homework and grading assignments. Ai  “has also been used to develop interactive games to assist young children's academic and social skills as well as create lesson plans.

Ai is also a big part of writing tools. Grammarly, the AI-based spelling and grammar-check tool, is one well-known example  of this. “The program offers advice for clarity, tone, and other qualities to improve writing.” Something similar is, ChatGPT , it is able to rewrite, edit, or make changes to documents as needed.  AI tools can also help with writing prompts. They can create unique story ideas, dialogue, and it can help writing teachers come up with ideas to help with teaching.

There is also a wide range of existing and potential applications for AI in early childhood education. It can be used to create interactive games and other teaching tools that can teach young children academic or social skills. There is also Artificial intelligence can also be used to power monitoring systems. This can be used as a teacher's assistant/ helper. It, pays attention to children when the teacher is busy and evaluates their behavior. “Some studies have shown that AI can improve teaching and learning in early childhood education, including developing language skills"

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;">Artificial intelligence in video games used programming that allows certain characters in a video game, like non-playable characters (NPC’S), and in game enemies, to act like they have a mind of their own.
Pacman, the popular game from the 80s is one of the most famous examples of early AI.
The ghosts in the game are programmed to know Pacman’s location, but each one is set to act a differently in response to it.
One of the ghosts is set to wander, one is set to follow Pacman, one is set to go in the direction where Pacman is going, one is set to move randomly unless another ghost is close to catching Pacman, and the last ghost is set to follow Pacman when he’s far away, but go to a specific location on the map when he’s close.
These four behaviors make these ghosts, look like they are moving on their own. That is the purpose of AI in video games.
Nearly all games use AI to some extent or another. Without it, it would be hard for a game to provide an immersive experience to the player.
As AI gets better and more advanced, the options for how it interacts with a player change/ develop.

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;">A lot of jobs are worried about getting taken over by ai, this may be true for some jobs. Even thought a lot of jobs are at risk from AI, teaching is a job that is hard to replace ( K-12 level.) This was proven during the pandemic when it showed how valuable in-school learning is, young students need that face to face interaction in order to get a better understanding., AI technologies can provide a lot of help  to teachers, helping them save time and use their energy with more valuable/ personable tasks.

AI programs like ChatGPT can help with creating lesson plans, assisting with grading papers and homework, offering personalized help to students, and even creating videos from textbooks.
AI can also improve job matching. it can also use chatbots and voice assistants to interact with people applying for jobs. This assess their communication skills, personality, and motivation. By using AI for job matching, employers can enhance the quality and efficiency of hiring people.
